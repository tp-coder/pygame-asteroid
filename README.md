# pygame-asteroid

A python game build using pygame for fun!

# Ideas to extending the game!

- [x] Add a scoring system
- [x] Implement multiple lives and respawning
- [x] Implemented Game Over window with possibility to restart or quit the game
- [ ] Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- [ ] Add acceleration to the player movement
- [ ] Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- [ ] Add a background image
- [ ] Create different weapon types
- [ ] Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- [ ] Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- [ ] Add a shield power-up
- [ ] Add a speed power-up
- [ ] Add bombs that can be dropped

**I'll make each idea as done as I go along.**
